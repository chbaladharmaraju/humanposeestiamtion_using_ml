# Human Pose Estimation using Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of human pose estimation using machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning-based approaches like CNNs and Transformers. The project focuses on detecting key points of human joints in images and videos.

## Features
- **Pretrained Models**: Uses state-of-the-art models like OpenPose, HRNet, or MediaPipe.
- **Real-time Estimation**: Supports real-time pose estimation using webcam input.
- **Dataset Support**: Compatible with COCO, MPII, and custom datasets.
- **Visualization**: Keypoint plotting and skeleton rendering.
- **Training and Fine-tuning**: Scripts to train on custom datasets.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/human-pose-estimation.git
   cd human-pose-estimation
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. (Optional) Install PyTorch:
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
   ```

## Usage
### Running Inference
To perform pose estimation on an image:
```bash
python infer.py --image path/to/image.jpg
```

To perform pose estimation using a webcam:
```bash
python infer.py --webcam
```

### Training a Model
To train the model on a custom dataset:
```bash
python train.py --dataset path/to/dataset --epochs 50
```

## Datasets
Supported datasets:
- **COCO Keypoints Dataset**
- **MPII Human Pose Dataset**
- **Custom datasets** (requires annotation conversion)

## Model Architecture
- **CNN-based Approaches**: OpenPose, HRNet, PoseNet
- **Transformer-based Approaches**: ViTPose

## Results
Example results can be found in the `results/` directory.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Add support for 3D pose estimation.
- [ ] Improve real-time performance with TensorRT.
- [ ] Implement mobile-friendly models.
